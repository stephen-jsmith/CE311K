The librarian in a real library can help you best if you give it the dewey decimal associated with the book. The dewey decimal for us is a url, which we change based on what information we want.

    "Great question Stephen! The first part of answering this question is to ask another question- **How do we store where we want to go?** This is where we begin to use Pandas. Pandas is pretty much just google sheets, but in Python. Instead of a spreadsheet, we use this fancy thing called a ```DataFrame```.  ```DataFrames``` are pretty cool, and can read data from .csv files super easy. We can start by importing our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access data, we use a ```with open('name of file', 'mode') as ____:``` statement. What this does is only keep the file open as long as we need to. If we keep it open, then it can start to mess with the memory of our computer until killed. The ```'name of file'``` argument is just giving python directions on where to find the info. Next, we have ```mode```, which tells python what we are going to be doing to this file. The two main ```modes``` we can use are ```\"r\"```, read mode, or ```\"w\"```, write mode. Finally, we need to give the file a temporary name, which goes in the blank spot. This is just how we will refer to it when grabbing information. A common name to give it in this application is ```data```. Let's try this out: "
